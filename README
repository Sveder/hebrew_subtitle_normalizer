There is nothing more simple yet so needed (at least for my parents :) - somehow Israeli 
subtitle makers still haven't discovered UTF-8, and they save their subtitles at the Hebrew
code page in DOS (CP1255). Programs like VLC don't like code pages and display the equivelant
in the default code page, meanin we see latin characters instead.


Usage:
hebrew_subtitles_normalizer.py <subtitle_file>
The old subtitles will be saved with a .old extension, in case the script is not the fix you
were looking for.
